Intro sessions are free, and that&#039;s where we brainstorm our ideas. These aren&#039;t part of the course structure but marketing sessions.

Vision &amp; Planning are also free, and that&#039;s where we turn ideas into visions and plans.

This place requires schedule information.

We should run 6 month programs. (Semester based) Then break programs such as winter and summer. When teaching any project, it needs to be complex enough to take 6 months, and easy enough that it doesn&#039;t take any longer. Possible year programs. Still requires research and testing with this.
