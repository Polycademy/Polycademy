<p>
This plugin will automatically upgrade your wiki to the newest available DokuWiki version by performing the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Downloading the new DokuWiki package</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Unpacking the package</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Checking the needed permissions</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Updating the wiki files</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For automatic upgrading all files that need to be updated have to be writable by the <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> process. The plugin will check for the required file permissions before starting the upgrade process.
</p>

<p>
This will not upgrade any installed plugins or templates. Creating a backup of your wiki is recommended before continuing is highly recommended.
