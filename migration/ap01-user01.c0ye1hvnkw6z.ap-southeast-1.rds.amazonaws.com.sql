I also am constantly attempting to come up with ideas for a Startup, I just need to come up with just the right idea and be able to build it with the skills I learn at Polycademy.\n\nI have an eclectic mix of interests and skills - I topped my school in English and Visual Arts, and also finished in the top five in both Extension Mathematics and Software Design and Development. At university I graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture (Hons I), but in my first design degree I majored in digital media in which I studied web design and 3D animation. As a Revit user, I’ve built parametric families in Revit, making use of my programming knowledge in the architectural field. I also enjoy writing, dragon-boating and training for half-marathons.\n\nI am in the process of  setting up a web page as an ongoing project to practice and showcase my web design skills. I ultimately want to turn this into a web development business,  but at this point I need to learn so many elements that feed into web development - the full stack. I would ultimately love to design websites and apps for organisations and groups under my own studio name, but I would need to hone my skills working for a development company first.  \n\nI am also very interested in the Code for Australia program. I volunteered for three months in 2006 in Peru with an NGO working on development projects in remote communities, and I am interested in social issues and the idea of using my skills to help others. Code for Australia is something I would be interested in becoming involved with once I have the skills and the means to do so.\n\nI have the creativity, the drive, the determination - all I need is the web development skills to be able to create something special.

However, I am an aspiring web developer, and have been actively designing my own curriculum in web development through self-learning and building. In fact, I just attended my first hackathon in Seattle, Washington last weekend. \nThrough various resources such as MIT''s OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) and Codeacademy (codeacademy.com), I have learned a wealth (and am still actively learning) of knowledge about building websites and coding the back-end. From designing and writing a game in Javascript at that hackathon (http://ischaaf.com/roshki/examples/roshki.html) to Ruby on Rails, I am definitely hooked. However, I believe that personally, I need the structure and environment that Polycademy offers in order to truly unlock my potential.\nI would love to get involved with your Code for Australia project, and experience the culture of another country. As far as projects go, when accepted to Polycademy, I would build an interface that allows for the public to track common imports/exports through Australia and the world, and see where their products come from. I have searched data.gov.au and found a few databases that could come in handy for this (such as http://data.gov.au/dataset/international-trade-in-goods-and-services-australia-apr-2011/). With my experience in database management through SQL and SAS (one of the most flexible and powerful analyzing/processing tools in the market to the date) I believe I could build something quite incredible. \nTo close, I believe that the best thing Polycademy can offer me is the training as an entrepreneur-connecting with people, selling yourself, and innovating. I recently hacked my way into a TEDx conference (read about my experience on the blog on my website- www.KevinMyron.com) where I experienced the rush of pitching your own &quot;story&quot; and learning that of others. It truly is amazing. \nI believe I will bring a lot to the class, and that the class can do wonders for me. Not to mention I would love to be within the first generation of coding for Australia. I have a daunting task ahead of me in proving myself without a formal college degree. Yet I believe that knowledge and experience is not exclusive to a university; it is universal. Learning never stops, as long as you always pursue it.\n-Kevin Myron,\nwww.KevinMyron.com', 'I heard about Polycademy from the link provided under &quot;resources&quot; on Uncollege.org.

(70, 'The Launch of Polycademy & Code for Australia', '<p>Hi my name is Roger, I started Polycademy & Code for Australia. Let me tell you a short story:</p>\n\n<p>In our modern day era, <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/">some people</a> have claimed that learning to code is just as important as learning to read or write. With the pervasiveness of digital technologies, if it isn''t equivalent, it''s damn near close.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/internet_matters">McKinsey Institute</a>, the internet accounted for 21% of GDP growth among developed countries. Among G20 economies the internet will bloom to <a href="https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/media_entertainment_strategic_planning_4_2_trillion_opportunity_internet_economy_g20/">$4.2 trillion US dollars</a>. But what does all these statistics mean to the average person?</p>\n\n<p>For me at Polycademy, it means two things: Jobs and Empowerment.</p>\n\n<p>Coders and programmers are in high demand nowadays. <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/09/20/need-a-job-youd-better-learn-to-code/">Startups and big companies</a> participate in a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/12/opinion/rushkoff-write-code/index.html">talent war</a> for good developers. Traditional universities just don''t teach the practical side of things. In the programming world, paper certificates are meaningless, it''s the code and projects that you have brought to life that matters.</p>\n\n<p>But the really important factor is not jobs, it is <a href="http://sachagreif.com/please-learn-to-code/">empowerment</a>. In closing the digital divide, more people become content creators rather than just content consumers. Learning to code is about empowering people to allow them to unleash their creativity in the digital era. No other skill allows you to reach and be heard from hundreds, thousands, if not millions of people in such a short time. Coding gives aspiring entrepreneurs an ability to turn their ideas into reality.</p>\n\n<p>Polycademy was setup to help entrepreneurs and reskilling people <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1619-theres-always-time-to-launch-your-dream">achieve their dreams</a>. It isn''t an online based codecademy, and it isn''t your standard brick and mortar school. Polycademy will take small groups of highly committed individuals from different fields and stages of life and turn them into web developers. Not by teaching computer science, nor handing out paper based qualifications, but by helping them bit by bit, week by week flesh out their idea into reality. Beginners and noobs are welcome! Many people are turned off by certain segments of the programming elite''s snobbery. But there won''t be any snobbery in Polycademy, everybody will be a world class beginner. Along the way our students will learn teamwork in high octane epic 11/21 week deadline environment. Entrepreneurial skills are a must, so students will get embedded with the entrepreneurial community in Canberra.</p>\n\n<p>Why Canberra some would ask? Well here''s where it gets really interesting and awesome. Early this year, I found out this awesome non-profit organisation in America called "<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>". They call themselves the peace corp for geeks. For non-US people, that means they get professional programmers to volunteer their time to build applications that solve civic or community issues. This has met widespread success, with many city governments paying almost $160,000 for Code for America''s services. But wait I just said non-profit and "volunteering"! Where''s all that money going? Well it''s going to the programmers. Volunteering isn''t cheap, and Code for America has stocked the program will all sorts of activities and guests lectures from the influential in the technology sector. It''s simply a great place to get started in life, or to reach another tipping point in life for many of their developer fellows. I was inspired by them, and while I was inspired I realised there was a synergy here between a school that intensively teaches web application development, and development for the public good.</p>\n\n<p>That''s when I came up with Code for Australia. Now Code for Australia will be a social enterprise program at Polycademy. The url is <a href="http://codeforaustralia.com.au/">http://codeforaustralia.com.au/</a> However it hasn''t been setup yet, but definitely bookmark it. Code for Australia will be slightly different from Code for America. Instead of getting professional developers to volunteer their time, Code for Australia will be sponsorship based. Students who get accepted into the program get free or seriously discounted tuition, but they have to develop an application dealing with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/welcome-2012-cfa-accelerator-startups/">open government or community issues</a>. These applications can range from disaster alert and prevention software and environmental geo-mapping to data visualisation of where your tax is going. A great example is Google''s <a href="http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/projects/armsglobe/">global arms imports/exports visualisation</a>. (Only works on advanced browsers!) These kinds of projects allow Government to engage its citizens in a more accessible way, and allow citizens to interact with the Government in a more dynamic way. <strong>In the digital era, open government is the cornerstone of democracy.</strong> In Australia, we''ll be using the Open Gov Data set provided by <a href="http://data.gov.au/">http://data.gov.au/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>2013 is when the journey begins for Polycademy and Code for Australia. Our first classes are in early February, and I have been negotiating with open government officials, entrepreneurs and investors. Everybody I''ve talked to has been supportive of the idea. Code for Australia cannot start without Polycademy, but without Polycademy there can be no Code for Australia. So the first step is to get Polycademy running. If you think you have an idea for an application that will change the world, then <a href="http://polycademy.com/courses">signup to the courses.</a> For early applications there''s a $1000 discount! Polycademy will be hiring 2 extra teachers before the start of class specialising in design and development, I personally don''t have all the answers to the world of web development. Code for Australia will require some time before it is fully ready to be launched, but if you''re interested in helping, why not talk to your Government official and ask them about it? </p>\n\n<p>The future of Polycademy and Code for Australia will be interesting. I want to focus on making Polycademy the premier destination for developing tech startups in Canberra and Australia. I want Code for Australia to take off in its own way, bringing the power of computer technology to help disaster zones and regions of poverty. No matter what, Polycademy will stay lean, practical and on top of emerging technologies.</p>\n\n<p>About the mentors, these three people, Rory, Craig and Lachlan have given me quite awesome advice regarding this startup. They are experienced in different fields as you may have read from their bios at the home page.</p>\n\n<p>Credit should be given where credit is due, although my inspiration of Polycademy came from similar startups in America (Dev Bootcamp, Starter League), the original formulation of the idea was independent. (Trust me!) The logo for Polycademy was designed from a designer in India at DesignCrowd, and the background for the hex icons came from a designer in the UK. Most of the icons used at the homepage came from the <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">theNounProject</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A little bit about me:</strong> I am currently a student at the Australian National University who (should) be graduating by the end of 2012. I''ve been building websites/applications since I was 12 years old, and have dabbled in leadership activities for a while (President of AIESEC ANU 2012 - 2013). In university I study Bachelor of Arts (International Relations). Within this degree, I have broadened my study area as much as possible including economics, environmental science, complexity and military history. I also dabbled in piloting.

(71, 'Should everyone learn to code?', '<p>Raghu Betina is a recent graduate from the 11 week program at <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">Starter League</a> (formerly Code Academy), a similar software academy in Chicago, USA. In a TEDx presentation, he relates the invention of the printing press to widespread literacy to the education revolution where everybody could read and write. He argues that a similar revolution is taking place in the computer technology field, where tools and code literacy will usher in a digital revolution, where the majority of humanity will become digital creators rather than just consumers. The is a matter of power, voice and creativity.</p>\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rtl9QG4qe6g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>In Ancient China and other civilisations, the population that could read or write were the rich, powerful and educated. They were the minority and through the power of reading and writing, they alone had the ability to direct the future of their civilisation and incidentally as we read history books, we realise all history is written by the literate elite. In the case of China, no written history comes directly from women. Unfortunately we have no idea what the female perspective of Ancient China was. When we lack perspective, we get a distorted view of history, as if whole pages were torn out of the book of history.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/VZUpV2l2TqaimMP3Qdhi" alt="Literacy World Map" />\n\n<p>When the majority of humanity became literate, there was an explosion of new ideas, perspectives and histories that were recorded and written down. The written word became integrated into every aspect of people''s lives. People who were once illiterate now had a voice. When the majority of humanity gains the ability to code, then computer technology will become integrated into every aspect of our lives. There will be an explosion of creativity and collaboration between the fields external to computer science. Innovation happens at the cross roads and cross pollination of different ideas and experiences.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>When you give experts of other fields the ability to code, they become dangerous.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Now what''s the difference between being able to program and other skills? Couldn''t the same argument be made for possibly learning how to play music? Or learning how to fly? I think the main difference is simply the ubiquity of computer technology. One can survive in this world without being able to fly a plane, but one won''t be able to if one isn''t able to read or write. Now we haven''t reached the point where being able to program is a necessity for daily life. But that point is approaching. This brings up an interesting point about how certain skills become so important that everybody has to be able to do them. Raghu missed a crucial step between having a printing press and widespread literacy.</p>\n\n<p>That step was economic. The turning point was the industrial revolution. When there was an economic pain point, people were motivated to upskill and demand better education. The industrial revolution made paper and books affordable to everybody. This in turn standardised and formalised widespread education.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we have the tools. There are many open source and free applications that allow you to get started building your application. The resources are free, you can find thousands of tutorials on Google. We also have a growing economic pain point. Take a look at <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">3D printers</a>. Imagine what would happen if 3D printers could self-replicate. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02myN2Y3iB4">Oh look they can!</a> Imagine then if we scaled that up. What could we be printing in the future? <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/d-printing-set-to-revolutionalise-housing-industry/story-fnd134gw-1226449726736">Skyscrapers?</a> The point is, manual labour is going to be automated away, even complex labour like construction. Controlling machines and computers is the domain of software. Software is disrupting every part of our economy (web software is even disrupting software itself). Even the thin layer of separation between what is real and what is cyberspace is getting thinner as we speak. Just take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">augmented reality</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>If you you want to catch the next revolution and ride the wave, then you should learn to code.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>What we lack is widespread education of coding, and in some parts of the world, we even lack the resources to access the internet. It''s called the digital divide, and it exists in both developed and developing countries. It''s not enough to have <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/12/blue-collar-software-development.html">CS courses in University</a>. They don''t actually teach programming as a trade anyway. The technology in highschools and primary schools are completely outdated and of course some schools don''t teach it. Closing this digital divide is the next step before Raghu''s envisioned revolution, and Polycademy will be doing its bit in making that future closer to today.</p>\n\n<p>The world is changing, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/bloomberg-codecademy/">software is making that happen</a>. If you you want to catch the next revolution and ride the wave, then you should learn to code. Start today. You can do tutorials, you can learn from books, or you can even join Polycademy. <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is a great place to start if you''re a complete beginner. It won''t be easy, but it''s not impossible. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16440126">Even the Mayor of NYC is doing it!</a></p>\n\n<p>Advocating code literacy is not about displacing professional developers. Even though most of humanity can read and write, there still exists professional writers and novelists. In fact without people being able to read and write, those writers would be out of a job! Code literacy != everybody should go become a web developer. Similarly, writing and reading literacy != everybody go become a writer. <a href="http://theindustry.cc/2012/09/21/why-we-should-all-learn-a-little-code-answer-and-infographic/">Code literacy means empowerment</a>. It gives people the ability to create, express and share ideas through cyberspace. It gives people a voice that can influence the future direction of human technology. Take a look at this TED presentation where programmers have actually built a better form of democracy that lawyers and politicians could never come up with.</p>\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CEN4XNth61o?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>Now if politicians and lawmakers did come up with it, then maybe we''d all be living in a better digital democracy. This is just a small fragment of what is to come. There could be innumerable innovations if coding was integrated into other fields, and there in lies the growth of development jobs and the growth of humanity. Should you learn to code? My answer is pretty obvious: Yes you should!</p>', '2012-11-14 04:47:43', 1, 'notices,coding,thoughts', 'should_everyone_learn_to_code'),

Well coworking is essentially a shared working space. It is mainly used by urban freelancers or entrepreneurs who are seeking an office space away from home without having to pay for the entire space or the entire time. These places are also good for meet ups and collaboration between different entrepreneurs. This reduces the typical isolation of professionals who work alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It''s not just a space but a community. A freelancing/entrepreneurial culture is required for these coworking spaces to succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I''ve been meeting up with Rory to discuss if and how Polycademy could use the space as its launchpad. A couple weeks ago, I attended a brief open house and was able to check out the premises. It requires a lot of refurbishment as some people have broken into it while it was abandoned and created some interesting artwork. The doors to this establishment is scheduled to be opened in 2013, that''s the same time as Polycademy is starting classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rory is currently taking in applications of interest for the renting of the coworking space. If you''re an entrepreneur and looking for a place outside home, free of distractions but also good for networking, then you should contact Rory on LinkedIn. Check out his profile at our homepage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A coworking place would be an ideal location for Polycademy, students would be able to mingle and see other entrepreneurs at work with their projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some photos that I took (as you can see there''s a lot of work to be done):</p>\r\n\r\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/JsdPhIESGuotgIITTFFK" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/csuPsW7TQBm0ZeXQuAtL" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/njS6cdBlRZKJ5x6HVxDM" alt="" />\r\n\r\n<p>The location for Polycademy isn''t confirmed, but this looks nice.

(132, 'Creating Code for Australia (mockup stage)', '<p>I''ve been busy creating the Code for Australia website. I decided to record my 3 hour long Photoshop mockup session, and then create a time lapse video reducing it down to 6:29 minutes. The video is not a tutorial, but you can see some of the processes I go through in order to quickly iterate through the design. You can see it on Youtube below.</p>\n\n<p>My workflow generally starts from wireframing and sketching using pen & paper, this may take a few hours or a few weeks depending on how complex the site/app is. In this case, I''m going for a simple single page web site, as it''s purpose currently is to generate interest, and operate like an online brochure or business card when I''m presenting to external stakeholders. I then move to Adobe Photoshop in order create a higher fidelity mockup, the purpose of this stage is to flesh out the drawings into something that is more orderly/colourful. The mockup can also be presented to any potential clients. While it is easier to iterate on paper, it''s easier to conceptualise the final design in Photoshop. The final stage in front end development is the prototyping stage in HTML/CSS/JS, which I''ll get to in a couple of days.</p>\n\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eXg2AdiQcqE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h4>Here are some of the resources that I used:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid</a> for alignment</li>\n<li><a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">Subtle Patterns</a> for textures and backgrounds</li>\n<li><a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/">Kuler</a> for colour selection</li>\n<li><a href="http://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a> for icons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There won''t be much back end code as there''s no dynamic processes happening yet. When Code for Australia actually launches with various applications, then the site will turn more complex.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some photos of the quickly drawn wireframes. My style of wireframing isn''t common, it''s more like scribbling. I guess every designer has their own style.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/HspCVmYpT1G38ht3xbau" alt="Code for Australia Wireframe 1" />\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/38m0ceOeToeL9NFMiFBO" alt="Code for Australia Wireframe 2" />\n\n<p>It is difficult to estimate the total amount of time taken to get to here, because I took many breaks in between the wireframing stage. If I had worked on it non-stop, I guess it probably would have taken 5 hours. Stay tuned for the next blog post showing the prototyping stage.</p>\n\n<p>Current stage of the website:</p>\n\n<a href="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/JAuYwXjsQo8rCm5Dj8rI"><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/R7ruY7ECSSETNWCo4nYQ" alt="Current Stage of CFA" /></a>\n\n<p>Oh and I believe I should be writing up a newsletter for all those who signed up to the newsletter.</p>', '2012-11-24 04:37:44', 1, 'design,photoshop,mockup,codeforaustralia', 'creating_code_for_australia_mockup_stage'),
(134, 'Creating Code for Australia (front end finished)', '<p><a href="http://codeforaustralia.com.au">Code for Australia</a>''s website is finished! Right now it''s only front-end with no back-end code. Well there wasn''t any need for backend code, although I was playing around with Laravel...</p>\n\n<p>Code for Australia''s two main programs are the Cross Disciplinary Innovation Track and Professional Developer Track. The fellows that are part of Code for America and Code for Europe fall into the Professional Developer Track. The reason that Code for Australia includes a different kind of program is because of the synergy between an educational institution (such as Polycademy) and the outcomes that Code for X programs try to achieve. This synergy is essentially the ability to acquire cross disciplinary innovation. Throughout my life, I''ve always noticed that blue skies innovation comes from a mixing of different ideas and fields, whereas process innovation (like marginal efficiency gains) comes from specialisation in one field. This is echoed by the "Medici Effect" book, you can find it <a href="http://www.themedicigroup.com/the-medici-effect">here</a>. Therefore in order to tap into blue skies innovation, Code for Australia''s Cross Disciplinary Innovation Track will bring in people who want to technologically innovate the public service(s), with backgrounds outside of software development, and get them to understand web application development through Polycademy. We then go to Government institutions and say that we could provide them with Professional Developer volunteers or Cross Disciplinary Innovators (which could come from their organisation as a training package or externally).</p>\n\n<p>Both of these tracks will achieve Code for Australia''s goal of open source governance, but they will do it differently and perhaps with interesting differing results. While Professional Developers may be able to produce applications quickly, these are only marginal improvements to open source governance. In order to truly integrate digital democracy, we need people outside of software development to understand the ramifications of the digital revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Now, onto some code. You may notice that there are some changes compared to the Photoshop mockup. The final website layout will not always look like the Photoshop mockup. This is true primarily because Photoshop mockups are static layouts and there isn''t any interactivity that can be coded in. Therefore when it comes to producing via html/css/js, things will look a little different. The Photoshop mockup is just there as a guideline and also to help with image graphic slicing.</p>\n\n<p>I unfortunately did not get a chance to record my progress, I''m currently working on a slow laptop. However there were a couple things that I discovered while creating this layout. Perhaps they will help others who are trying to figure out the same problem.</p>\n\n<h4>CSS Negative Margin Overlap Trick</h4>\n\n<p>On the photoshop file you may have seen numbers trying to overlap the backgrounds of their own container and the parent container. I knew this was possible in CSS with negative margins, so I scoured the internet for a solution. I couldn''t find one, so I did a small test using jsfiddle.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/N11rHTHSsOLtnY4wr3Ws" alt="Negative Margin Overlap Trick image" />\n\n<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/CMCDragonkai/VFV2Q/1/embedded/result,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\n<p>I wanted to have the numbers to be contained within the sections that they were denoting. In order to have extend and overlap onto the parent container, there needed to be a negative margin-top for the 1. The trick was to have the section container to also have a negative margin-top and a positive padding-top to push up the background colour underneath the 1. No need for z-index!</p>\n\n<p>In order to implement it in Twitter Bootstrap with the sections being in rows was a bit more difficult. This was because the Bootstrap''s rows were interfering with the negative margins, and we needed them to behave like stacked rows. In order to solve this issue, an even simpler and more cross-browser css solution was needed.</p>\n\n<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/CMCDragonkai/wppLr/1/embedded/result,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\n<p>And there it is, all you need is to make the number float:left or right. By making the number float, the browser ignores its size when setting out the flow of the content, and simply assumes it doesn''t exist when putting up the section''s background. You still a need a negative margin for the number, but the section no longer requires negative margin because the floated element is not counted. I used an inline element as the numbers, but this should work for other applications when you need tag or label for any sectional content. You could even design dates for blog articles to work like this.</p>\n\n<h4>Twitter Bootstrap''s Row Based Vertical Centering</h4>\n\n<p>Twitter''s bootstrap is an amazing HTML/CSS/JS framework. It really speeds up the development of the website frontend. However its framework can have confusing results because of all the magic under the hood. So on Photoshop, I wanted to vertically center (and horizontally center) this multilined content in the second section box.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/HCE8zaOfTreWdRcbLftb" alt="Vertical Centering Image for Twitter Bootstrap" />\n\n<p>What I was trying to do was vertically center some content inside Bootstrap''s row. There are <a href="http://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/vertical-centering-with-css/">many</a> ways of doing this in CSS and <a href="http://css-tricks.com/vertically-center-multi-lined-text/">every one of them</a> feels like a hack. Anyhow, I used the table method because it was the most obvious and simple. Here''s some pseudo code.</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code>\n.parent_container {\ndisplay:table;\n}\n.vertically_centered_content {\ndisplay:table-cell;\nvertical-align:middle;\n}\n</code>\n</pre>\n\n<p>This ends up not working if you use Twitter Bootstrap''s row functionality. Basically if you look at the site, the multilined text is in a row with the image of a ballot box to the right. I was using the row functionality in order to make them behave as a row in a big browser and in a small browser they would stack up vertically.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/7k71DqCkSDKlt91WIr6w" alt="Image of the row aligned content and image" />\n\n<p>Unfortunately the table method of vertical alignment doesn''t work with the rows. Which is sad because sometimes when people want elements aligned up in a row, they also want them to be aligned up vertically.</p>\n\n<p>In order to solve this issue, I had to abandon the row functionality completely. Incidentally the same method that allows vertical align, when combined a few percentages will create a row like functionality anyway.</p>\n\n<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/CMCDragonkai/gHgVG/1/embedded/result,html,css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>\n\n<p>So there you have an alternative to Twitter Bootstrap''s row functionality that allows vertical centering. It even works cross-browser.* You can''t see it in the jsfiddle example, but if there is a real image with proper widths and heights and display:block, it will even stack vertically when the screen gets too small.</p>\n\n<p>*(I don''t support < IE8.)</p>\n\n<h4>Bootstrap Span Centering</h4>\n\n<p>If you are using Bootstrap''s span to create a responsive width, and you want to center it. Just add this to the container:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code>\n.container_with_bootstrap_span_centered{\nfloat: none;\nmargin: 50px auto;\ndisplay: table;\n}\n</code>\n</pre>\n\n<p>Ok I''m done.

This is the backend, and it competes with the likes of PHP, Python and Ruby on Rails. This is why I think Node is so popular: (warning this blog post is going to get quite technical!)</p>\n\n<h4><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web">Real Time Web</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Applications</a></h4>\n\n<p>This is the one I''m most excited about. Web applications have a number of advantages over desktop applications, one of which is the ability to write once and run everywhere. One major disadvantage is that desktop applications that are downloaded and executed on your own computer, has always seemed more snappier and more events can happen at the same time. This is because the web as it stands runs on HTTP request - response model.</p>\n\n<p>There is no state that is kept between requests and responses. Your computer and browser (client) sends a request to the server (my website), the server processes and outputs some content, in which it responds to your computer and then forgets you ever existed, until of course you send in another request. The connection between my server and your computer is not persistent, there is no constant communication, and hence the web is not real time and is "<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/stateless.html">stateless</a>".</p>\n\n<p>Web developers innovated around this limitation by using sessions/cookies, iframes, AJAX and other interesting hacks in order to make applications seem instant and realtime. That''s what you see in Facebook, where your friend''s status updates are constantly pushed to your browser and you can instantly chat with your friends. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">6 years ago that would have been impossible at Facebook''s 1 billion user scale!</a></p>\n\n<p>For the last few years several innovations came together in order to deal and ultimately remove this disadvantage from web applications:</p>\n\n<p>Firstly AJAX improved and the Javascript implementation of it in our browsers was standardised with JQuery. This was the answer to creating "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application">Rich Internet Applications</a>" (RIA) otherwise known as Web 2.0.</p>\n\n<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/SOA_Detailed_Diagram.png/640px-SOA_Detailed_Diagram.png" alt="SOA" />\n\n<p>Secondly tech entrepreneurs wanted to integrate various applications or services together, but the data used by these RIAs was in a closed loop process, they didn''t share their data. So people created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> APIs (representational state transfer & application programming interfaces) to initiate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web services</a> revolution. (There was a brief stint with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>, but SOAP sucks so most people don''t use it). APIs have existed in the past to allow machine to machine communication over the web, but it required the RESTful design model to unify the protocols and data structures, in which web applications communicated with each other in order to be truly useful. This is what gives us the concept of the cloud or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29">mashups</a>" or software/infrastructure/platform as a service. RESTful also supported non XML (extensible markup language) based messages, specifically JSON (Javascript Object Notation). JSON is more lightweight than XML, so it has become more popular as the data format to use when communicating through RESTful web services to clients (such as your browser) and other servers. This popularity of JSON becomes quite important to Node.js later on.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/joxUo19FQzKeJGHFNseH" alt="Web SOA styles" />\n\n<p>Going into the construction of RESTful architecture is a bit too much for this blog post. But you can read this <a href="http://rest.elkstein.org/">excellent tutorial</a> about a simple RESTful application. All you have to know is that RESTful web services use the standard HTTP protocols to Create, Read, Update and Delete data (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>). Web applications simply send a request with an accompanying HTTP method (get/post) to a unique URL in another web application/\nservice. That URL then returns some data or does some operation if your request was authenticated. This data is usually formatted in JSON, and it is just raw data. There''s no HTML or CSS or Javascript to style it. If your browser visited that URL, it wouldn''t know what to do with it. But that''s the beauty of the non-styled data, machines or applications can read that data, and manipulate into using it for whatever nefarious purposes. That''s why you have so many different Twitter & Facebook mashups, they all use the same API (same URLs), but they can use that data for different things. Some will combine it into a social media control panel, others will use it for analytics. The possibilities for web service mashups are endless, and many companies have been built on top this sharable data. Just take a look at <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">Programmable Web</a>, a news portal of new mashups. Or you can take a look at <a href="http://codeforaustralia.com.au">Code for Australia</a>''s example section.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/jiLESAueQsC72N9EsVIR" alt="Flash is dead or dying." />\n\n<p>Thirdly, the former omnipresent Flash died. Some may <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/30/steve-jobs-war-against-flash/">blame Apple</a>, but I think it was just a matter of time before this proprietary multimedia platform was replaced by standards from the W3C (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML 5</a>). Ok I jest, Flash is not yet dead. But any company looking to the future of web applications won''t be building it on Flash. Flash is still used on Youtube, but that''s mainly because HTML 5 video hasn''t caught up yet, but in order to satisfy iOS users, Youtube provides those videos on HTML 5 or through Apple''s app. HTML 5 is not just some new markup syntax, but it is a set of protocols and application programming interfaces that gets integrated into modern browsers, (Firefox/Chrome/Opera) that allows us to create complex web applications and cross platform mobile applications like <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>. The two APIs that are quite exciting and relevant to real time web is the release of Web Sockets, and the development of Web RTC.</p>\n\n<p>Web Sockets allow full duplex persistent connections between the browser and the server. Previously in order to attain a semblance of real time applications, AJAX RIAs would <a href="http://dsheiko.com/weblog/websockets-vs-sse-vs-long-polling">long poll</a> the server in order to receive updates. This kind of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Ajax">comet programming</a>" was still based on the HTTP request response model. The server could not push updates to the browser, so what they did is get the browser to constantly send requests to the server to ask if there is any new updates, and when there is, the browser retrieves the new update. This was understandably inefficient and complex to maintain, when there were many users on the application, it was quite easy to overload the server. There were other methods mentioned <a href="http://www.websocket.org/quantum.html">here</a>. The point is, these methods were not truly realtime, and since it was still using the request response model, it introduces unnecessary latency and useless data being transferred with the HTTP Headers information. If only we could have a single persistent duplex (two way between client and server) protocol available... Well we do now. It''s called web sockets, which is used to provide true real time communication between the server and the client. This allows us to build chat applications very easily and can allow multiplayer games, or collaborative environments such as Google Docs or Cloud 9.</p>\n\n<p>A similar technology is being developed as we speak which is <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">web RTC</a>. This stands for real time communication. The RTC is designed for audio and video content, whereas web sockets is used for messages. When this is released in modern browsers, we''ll be able to do peer to peer (your browser to another person''s browser) real time communication. For example, you will no longer need Skype. Your browser could just hook up to web cam and then connect to another person''s browser. Other applications involve intensive graphic streaming like videos or instant live streaming without going through a third party service. Your radio could replaced with just a browser. You could share files with your friend just by launching your browser. Now why can''t we use web sockets for this? Well web sockets operate over TCP, and it emphasises reliability over timeliness. When you''re streaming video or audio, you won''t notice a missing pixel, but you will notice lag, so web RTC operates over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol">RTP while using the UDP protocol</a>, this tolerates packet losses, so your information won''t be corrupted just because a pixel disappeared in the vast internet while streaming your video. The web RTC is still very experimental and early stages, perhaps one day it may superseded web sockets, but it shows the direction of where the web is going, more distributed and more interconnected.</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, the rise of the single page application. This is quite well explained by <a href="http://blog.nodejitsu.com/single-page-apps-with-nodejs">Nodejitsu''s blog post</a>. The above mentioned innovations has convinced some companies and startups to create applications that operate on a client heavy architecture. Essentially, the server is now just a proxy or REST sink for some real time data storage. The user interface and user experience is handled on the client side. This would not be possible without the heavy competition between browser vendors in improving Javascript execution speed. It works like this, your browser visits a web application web site, it downloads the Javascript which contains all the necessary view templates, everything that implements your user interface and manipulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a> (document object model). It downloads this once. The web application essentially lives inside your browser. As you interact with your application, it simple sends HTTP requests or socket requests (or in the future RTC requests) to the server. The server is just a REST sink or socket sink. It does not serve up any HTML, it doesn''t serve up anything that would be useful to the browser alone, it simply outputs data. This data could be wrapped in JSON if it was a RESTful architecture, or it could just be socket data. The web application in your browser interprets the data and uses it to manipulate your user interface. This cuts down on unnecessary downloads, everything you need is already on your computer, the only thing that changes is the data such as your friend''s status updates or real time stock market information. There is no browser reload, there was only ever 1 page you downloaded, hence the single page app.</p>\n\n<a href="http://blog.nodejitsu.com/single-page-apps-with-nodejs"><img src="http://blog.nodejitsu.com/single-page-apps-with-nodejs/SPAs.png" alt="Single Page App architecture (from Nodejitsu)" /></a>\n\n<p>Welcome to the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/say-hello-to-the-real-real-time-web/">real time web</a>. The advantages of using client heavy architecture is that your entire server is just an API, and you can create clients to suit different platforms, yet still use the same server APIs. Your mobile app, your web app, your ipad app, your desktop app, your mashup all could be designed differently and have different styles, but your server doesn''t care. It doesn''t need to worry about all of that. It just needs to perform CRUD on the RESTful requests or socket requests. The end user, your customer doesn''t care about the magic being performed and the back end, the user experience on the front end, in his/her browser is what matters. The philosophy with single page apps is to make the front end beautiful and awesome, and keep the data and any heavy CPU processing on the back end and keep it invisible and flexible.</p>\n\n<p>So coming back after that whirlwind tour of the development of the web, what does this all mean for Node.js and why is it relevant?</p>\n\n<p>All of the above technologies require a new paradigm in programming. They require vast amounts of scalable concurrent connections with low CPU usage. There are a number of ways to develop this model. You may have recently heard about how Twitter changed from Ruby on Rails to Scala and is now using Jetty. Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell, Go language, and of course Node.js with Javascript all emphasise concurrency and asynchronous programming. But what makes Node.js so compelling is that the entry level is low, it''s Javascript the most popular web programming language in existence. It runs everywhere. It runs on the browser, which is a fundamental asset to the web space. People know Javascript and the community is large, so Node.js is accessible, it''s fast, it''s concurrent and it''s scalable. Now there is one downside to Node.js, it runs on a single thread compared to those other languages. This makes it somewhat difficult to scale to multi-core computers and run CPU intensive activities, however developers are working on extending Node.js to multiple cores as we speak! And also you should be forking any CPU intensive activities to another web service or programming language, not running on a single Node.js thread.</p>\n\n<p>Wait! Let''s analyse why Node.js is so suited to the real time web. Node.js  works on event driven asynchronous programming. Most programming languages are procedural and imperative. This means code is evaluated in a synchronous manner, that is one by one, line by line. In order to handle concurrent connections, you need to be able to write asynchronous code. Code is evaluated simultaneously. For example, imagine a web application that is connected to 5 different separate independent web services. Perhaps a social mashup pulling in updates from multiple Facebook and Twitter clones. In synchronous programming, code is evaluated one by one, and you would need to wait for each service to return the request before moving onto the next. What happens if one of the services lag? Well your entire application hangs! Asynchronous programming allows for all the queries to be executed at the same time. It doesn''t care when they return data, but they do, they run a callback which executes the event. So you can skip slow services and keep moving on, when that slow service finally returns, it catches up with a callback. Your response time for the web app mashup is reduced to slowest query rather than the combined time of all queries. This <a href="http://debuggable.com/posts/understanding-node-js:4bd98440-45e4-4a9a-8ef7-0f7ecbdd56cb">blog post explains it a bit better</a>. When this is connected with web sockets or long polling, the end user receives the formatted data from the other 4 web services even if the 5th one is slow, whereas in synchronous he would have to wait for all of them to finish before receiving the final output, and there goes your customer!</p>\n\n<p>Since JSON is the premier data format for the real time web, Node.js with Javascript integrates well with that as JSON is native to Javascript as it is the "Javascript Object Notation". No need to serialise and unserialise with other languages. Because Javascript works on both the browser and now the server, this unified front end & back end makes it very easy to share code and to have both back end and front end developers working together.</p>\n\n<p>The web is becoming more and more real time. For this to happen it has to become more interconnected and social. I don''t mean social in terms of human social, but social machines. Machines and applications will become more social and more distributed. Web applications and programming languages cannot be siloed in their respective communities, they have to communicate and be social with each other. Perhaps this will lead to the rise of the "<a href="http://www.wibit.net/blog/are_you_polyglot_developer_strive_it">Polyglot</a>" programmer (see the resemblance?), or perhaps it will lead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29">Skynet</a>. Who knows? All I can say is that this field is going to get really interesting, and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">software is definitely eating the world</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Why am I blogging about this?</h4>\n\n<p>Mainly because I''m planning a major application called Polyhack, a destination for those wanting to organise hackathons, designathons and gamathons (lan parties) or any live event that enjoys participation from the audience. I was originally just going to build something simple to list all of Polycademy''s events, but the more I thought about it, the more I realised that Polyhack would be useful to other people.</p>\n\n<p>Polyhack will be a mashup and is intented to integrate with multiple event and location services. For example Eventbrite, Facebook, Twitter, real time chat, live streaming, location search, fundraising & promotion, gamification for hackathon attendees and prize winners, showcasing... etc. The point is I realised that Node.js fits this purpose as it involves mashing up alot of web services, but it will also have real time chat and eventually other features for when the event runs. There must be real time pushing of data and social content (videos/photos/chat/twitter messages) to all the attendees and online lurkers. It would have an open API to allow further integration into the hackathon organiser''s own website or own application. Usually when one wants to organise an event like this, one would have to invest a lot of resources into making connections and marketing and logistics, I think Polyhack will help organisers make their organising simpler, and perhaps those one-off events won''t need invest into their own web application to make the event real time and connected. But more importantly I felt it would be an interesting challenge to learn pure Javascript and Node.js instead of just trying to write in PHP. So I''ll be documenting my efforts in learning Node.js and making Polyhack.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this all mean for Polycademy''s courses? Have I convinced you that <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/03/09/node-js/">Node.js is the future of web development</a>? Shouldn''t you be learning Node.js instead? Well I think Node.js is at a higher level of web development, not so much the Javascript part (since that''s part of basic browser JQuery stuff), but all the associated theory and concepts one has to understand. So yes, in the future Node.js will be part of the courses, but it will require previous experience in a serverside language such as PHP/Rails/Python or Javascript front end experience. And even further down the track, one could take on even more advanced true concurrent languages such as Haskell or Clojure or Go lang. But for 99% of people and 99% of web applications, we just don''t need them yet.</p>', '2012-12-21 02:57:12', 1, 'coding,node,polyhack', 'the_future_of_the_web_-_nodejs'),
(137, 'Assets & Logistics & Mentors and the impending launch!', '<p>Happy New Year! I’ve been busy organising the assets and logistics for the February launch. Unfortunately Entry 29 won’t be ready in time for the February launch. Fortunately I found a lot of good deals and another place that has potential. Furthermore, over the last 2 months, I received people who are interested in helping as mentors and many more developers interested in becoming lead instructors, co-instructors or teaching assistants. Some are even interstate!</p>\n\n<h3>Assets:</h3>\n\n<p>The big one would be computers! I’ve considered multiple options because are there are many different ways I could structure the class with the computers.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>No Computers, just BYO laptops. – This has the advantage of no capital costs required, but has the disadvantage of different working environments. Everybody’s computer is different and is probably running on different operating systems. This uncontrolled environment might become an issue with software incompatibilities and bugs in various systems. This can be offset by using cloud development environments such as Cloud 9. However things that has to be done on the desktop such as graphics editing Photoshop, cannot be sufficiently “clouded”.</li>\n<li>Single server and multiple thin clients. – I have a 60 kilogram industrial server under the bed. I got it for about $350, when it was being sold. It was probably worth $5000. It has about 60 gigabytes of RAM. Then 15 thin clients can be connected to the server, the operating system can be virtualised so everybody just runs their workspace on one server. This has the advantage of low capital costs, but there’s too much complexity involved in setting this up. There’s also a single point of failure, if that server goes, everything goes with it. In the end I still need monitors, keyboards, mouses… etc. Thin clients aren’t very cheap either.</li>\n<li>Google Chrome Box – The Chrome Box is an operating system that is geared towards the cloud. Essentially everything you are running should be running over the internet. This has similar problems to the No Computers, just BYO laptops, since it still requires the cloud and I cannot run Photoshop.</li>\n<li>Cheap Linux boxes – After talking to a supplier, it is possible to get a computer box at $350 with no operating system. While this is cheap, it has 2 disadvantages. Firstly with that many tower boxes, it’s going to be noisy and not very portable in such a small classroom. Secondly I still cannot run Photoshop natively (without using Wine).</li>\n<li>Macs – Macs are too expensive. Nuff said.</li>\n<li>All in One Computers – Computers in Australia are abnormally more expensive than ones in the US. So I was considering shipping them from the US. Even though the shipping cost combined with the retail prices would still save me money, it wasn’t going to arrive in time. At least there was no guarantee, and this is business critical if I need computers here by February. At any case I found 2 options that can be bought in Australia:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4><a href="http://shopap.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/auweb/LenovoPortal/en_AU/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=3634951826AE4D3881BFFF1AC5FCD957¤t-category-id=7BE68B6279DE80B2B92DB02D79A27094">The Lenovo</a></h4>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/SZHjHdnS86uD0brO3tnX" alt="" />\n\n<p>The Lenovo all in one is slightly cheaper than the Dell all in one, it has roughly the same kind of specifications though. However it requires external optional arm in order to have it stand up on the table. I personally don’t like the monitors with no feet. It offers keyboard and mouse bundled together.</p>\n\n<h4><a href="http://www.dell.com/au/p/inspiron-one-23-2330-aio/fs">The Dell</a></h4>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/s5GVKpbS2uIc30M6oDRE" alt="" />\n\n<p>The Dell has a very large screen. It’s quite good looking too. Both of these All in Ones can run Windows and Linux. They both will be quiet and portable. This also offers a wireless keyboard and mouse bundled together.</p>\n\n<p>So I’ve decided on a logic chart like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If I get 15 people or more signup to the course and pay their deposit, I’ll get Dell all in Ones.</li>\n<li>If I get 10 people or more signup to the course and pay their deposit, I’ll get Lenovo all in ones.</li>\n<li>If I get 5 people or more signup to the course and pay their deposit, I’ll have to remain on BYO laptops. I’ll use cloud IDEs to develop, and for graphics editing we can use GIMP. Or buy Photoshop via the Creative Cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A classroom also requires a whiteboard and projector. So why can’t we combine the whiteboard and projector? In fact we can! So I’m planning to get the <a href="http://www.epson.com.au/products/projector/EB-425W.asp?groupid=57">Epson EB425W projector at a short throw distance</a> and combining it with a whiteboard that doubles as a projector screen. I’ve found a dealer that’s willing to offer this all at $2000. Oh and the short throw mount means less shadows!</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/iDRT0MgQkq9ncxbqKy23" alt="" />\n\n<p>Furniture is another interesting issue. Depending on the location, I may have furniture supplied to me by the people who own the place, or I may have to bring in my own furniture. A Canberran company called Office Furniture Direct can offer me 8 Ronda Tables (fitting 2 people each) and 15 Mesh chairs at around $2800.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qprwImwXTSy8Clv5eAyT" alt="" />\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/fMwnO1ocRiaFASf75RNC" alt="" />\n\n<h3>Logistics</h3>\n\n<p>Because Entry 29 won’t be ready, I’ve had look for other places willing to offer a 3 month or 6 month lease. Currently I’ve found a place at 7 London Circuit. That’s right, it’s the same building where NICTA lives. This is a grade A office. It should be expensive. But it actually fits my budget! That is if I can get 10 or more people signup and pay the deposit. If I get lower than 10, I’ll have to move somewhere else, or only execute the 11 week program, as a shorter time means shorter lease. This place however is very very cool.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/7KiW09WmTBa6sEKvGJzn" alt="" />\n\n<h3>Mentors & Developers</h3>\n\n<p>I’ve secured a partnership with ReadSpeaker. It’s a company that focuses on turning web content into audio. They have major clients in the Government. They’ll open up their API so the students of Polycademy can learn web service architecture! The managing director of the Australia New Zealand division is even interested in speaking at Polycademy regarding entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and I’ve got about 5 other developers around the country who’s interested in becoming mentors for the students. The deal is a minimum of 1 hr a week. Each student or team part of Polycademy will have a mentor where you can discuss the weekly programming problems or entrepreneurial problems. They''ll all be up on a Partnership page soon.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve interviewed over 30 potential teaching assistants. About 10 of them are in the pipeline for the second interview. The second interview is actually a challenge, where they must create a video that teaches me something they didn’t know before. The results of this shall come around 20th January.</p>\n\n<p>Since posting the co/lead instructor jobs around the intertubes, I’ve received interest all around the country. Seems like such a job would be quite an interesting experience. There must be at least 15 students to justify the cost of bringing in another instructor. I myself will also be the lead instructor along with some teaching assistants.</p>\n\n<h3>Addendum:</h3>\n\n<p>To those coming to the event on Jan 15th, make sure to register an account on Cloud 9 and use firebug if you’re using Firefox! If you like to be adventurous, also register an account on Github and Appfog.</p>\n\n<p>The company account will be opened soon with Commonwealth Bank, so as per the terms and conditions I’ll be asking for deposits after the 15th January. The deadline will be 18th January.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and today and tomorrow is the last chance to enter the scholarship competition. Remember to be eligible you need to apply on the course page as well. This is so that I know your preferences.</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of the month, I’ll be focusing on developing the course material and putting it up onto a DevHub page on Polycademy’s website and sourcing more people. If I unfortunately don’t get enough people to sign up and pay the deposit, I’ll refund and have to move to another city :(.</p>\n\n<p>Oh I recently also scored an interview with Digital Sydney regarding Polycademy.</p>', '2013-01-11 20:13:50', 1, 'notices,events,business', 'assets_logistics_mentors_and_the_impending_launch'),

So I''m looking for companies/entrepreneurs to share the cost of the space.</p>\n\n<p>It''s a grade A officespace in Canberra, a room that can hold 15 people. It has dedicated bandwidth, receptionists, air conditioning, furnishings, furniture (15 desks and chairs), projector and whiteboard. It''s also possible to have full computer access to the multiple computers in the room.

We then turned these feature sets into a technology stack which included the generic solution stack to run any web application, and the technology stack that is used to solve their particular domain problem such as external APIs including Mailchimp, Google Maps.. etc.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ghX5n4ctSzOALl9c16Xn" alt="Class Photo" />\n\n<p>We also began our agile workflow, which meant that in every session, we have a scrum asking ourselves three questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What have you done since yesterday?</li>\n<li>What are you planning to do today?</li>\n<li>Any impediments/stumbling blocks?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of the students have different ideas for their web apps, and their all very exciting.

(141, 'Week 10 of Polycademy (T1, 2013)', '<p>The students have almost finished their 11 week journey in building their web application and potential startup. It has been an amazing experience seeing people with no prior programming experience get used to using third party libraries, gluing them together to solve a domain problem, thinking about the RESTful architecture of their web application, and debating the merits and performance of different algorithms or methods in solving the same problem.</p>\n\n<p>The course has evolved since Polycademy first started up, my philosophy in teaching has always went with hands on deployment, and instant practicality of the theories and practices to their own web application. However at first the focus was on basic CRUD (create read update and delete) applications, I''ve discovered every student''s web application requires a customised nurturing, as they face different problems and have different design/development requirements. The perspective of the developer was also important, as that affected what they thought was important to the completion of their web application. This course therefore focused on the commonality between software development theory/practice, but also provided exploration in specialised APIs or libraries (application programming interfaces) that solved a particular domain problem. The architectures of each student''s web application hence followed a RESTful style server sink that provided CRUD interfaces and data processing, but on the client side, we used AngularJS and jQuery in order to create single page application user experience. A single page application (SPA) is a client side javascript heavy application, that has two main properties. The first is that it interfaces with a server API to provide data dynamically through AJAX or WebSockets, and secondly all templating, page state transitions or animations take place on the client side. What this means for the end consumer is instant page transition or loading, real time updates, collaboration and synchronisation between the multiple clients through a Pub/Sub pattern. Overall it''s a better user experience, it grants more power and flexibility to the developer to craft experiences closer to a desktop application while retaining all the advantages of distribution in a web application. But I am digressing on the technical details. Just check out this <a href="http://yearofmoo-articles.github.io/angularjs-animation-article/app/#/ng-repeat">demo of AngularJS</a> with animation combined with AJAX loaded data. In user experience, people use motion as way to detect life. When you look at a dog, if the dog isn''t moving, it''s either dead, or a statue. Extrapolating to web applications, animations make an application come to life (real life things don''t just appear and disappear), and that''s why we marry the front end with the back end. (BTW I''m currently working on Polycademy V2 which will incorporate a number of new features and user experience aspects of SPAs.)</p>\n\n<p>In order to achieve these results, students had to master two programming languages, build tools, solution stacks, libraries, external APIs, markup languages such as HTML/CSS, preprocessors such as LESS, frameworks such as Codeigniter and AngularJS and of course computer science and software engineering theory. One of the students mentioned that he wanted to get to the stage, where he could look at any new library or programming language or third party API and know where to start to apply it. With regards to this, two problems always exist when a developer finds something new, firstly that there is often assumed knowledge even in the documentation, and secondly where to find the assumed knowledge. To overcome these two problems, the students had to learn a couple lessons not so much in technical programming, but an outlook on life. Firstly to not be afraid to dive into the rabbit hole of the documentation or wikified knowledge base. It is a learning experience in itself and a rewarding one, which leads us to life long learning. Often the answers are hidden under several layers of links, however along the way you''ll discover nuggets of knowledge. There is of course a large amount of noise on the internet, so I''ve had to help them locate the signal, but it takes time to be able to quickly filter out the noise from the signal. Secondly was not to be afraid of errors. That is to understand that the computer uses errors to tell you what is wrong, and it is also how they lead you the right solution (a philosophy subscribed by TDD practitioners!). A silent error is the worse error.</p>\n\n<p>It''s been a hard-won journey for the students. Some were grappling high level abstraction, functional programming, object orientation, event driven programming, state management, communication architecture, design patterns and <em>spherical trigonometry</em> all while studying full time at university or having full time jobs. There is a quality to the satisfaction, when you start to see connections form between different software stacks and have it all work in front of you. Yet their journey has not finished. Their applications will require polish after the course, and of course there is always more to learn, more technologies to discover, and more lives to change.</p>\n\n<p>We had a meetup last week with all the mentors and advisors, current students and potential future students. It was good to catchup and discuss the future of Polycademy. One thing that came up was an end of course demo day event for the students.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/obnxeMWYSniKQupi6tSd" alt="Mentor Meetup with Polycademy" />\n\n<p>We decided to organise two events, a practice pitching session for the Polycademy students on Saturday 13th April, which is open for anyone to participate. Anyone who''s interested in attending Polycademy should also come and check out the work.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly is the big demo day event, and this is basically for all entrepreneurs who are working on their technology startups to pitch and showcase to an audience of other entrepreneurs and people who are interested in tech startups (I''ll also be inviting potential employers). This is of course open to all people, it will be an unconference where the audience can act as lightning speakers or have full presentations on the web application or other projects they have been working on. This big event is scheduled for Friday 19th April last day of the course for cohort 1. And food will be provided.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Entrepreneurial Practice Pitching Session: <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com.au/event/6190527033">http://www.eventbrite.com.au/event/6190527033</a></li>\n<li>Canberra Tech Startup Demo Day: <a href="http://techstartupdemodayautumn2013-eorg.eventbrite.com.au/">http://techstartupdemodayautumn2013-eorg.eventbrite.com.au/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Oh and lastly, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/polyhack/">Polycademy is setting up a meetup group dedicated to web, mobile and desktop application development</a>.

(142, 'Final Pitches and Canberra Tech Startup Demo Day', '<p>We''re very excited to say that our first cohort of students have finished their intensive 11 week course just one week ago. In line with our vision of entrepreneurship, we practiced our final pitches and had a successful event on the 19th April where we invited startups from around Canberra to join Polycademy''s students and show case their web applications.</p>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/fuFV72UhQYWGBhdMDFpt" alt="Tim Wee practicing his pitch before the big event!" />\n\n<p>While we were practicing, we kept in mind a few points that I''d like to share. One important thing I learned while being in Sydstart last year, was that you should (almost) always start by sharing a story to define the problem, and then how your solution effectively solves it. It took practice, but the students sometimes forgot that they had to be able to link their solution back to the original problem they mentioned, this brings back the focus and keeps the pitch cohesive.</p>\n\n<p>When they were providing their story, it was important to help the audience visualise not only the problem, so they can identify with it, but also the solution. If it was too detail oriented, people forgot the big picture. This means juggling between big purposeful claims, and down to earth insights. They had to put people into the shoes of the end user, which meant illustrating the context of usage and the differentiating factor, what made people want to use your solution instead of another solution?</p>\n\n<p>Of course depending on the audience, you can then focus on the market opportunity, how you''re meant to monetise the service, and what you will be focusing on in the future, such what kind of help you need, financial or otherwise. For our audience, it was general, so at the final event, we decided to show case the actual implementation.</p>\n\n<p>The students focused most of their time on finishing their application and trying to learn as much as possible in their last week. In fact we ended up having a couple of almost all nighters with the stereotypical pizzas and drinks!</p>\n\n<p>On the day, we managed to get a wide variety of audience members and speakers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>ChessDimensions - Tim Wee talked about his progress at Polycademy and his plans for building ChessDimensions. On the day he was able to show case the preliminary user interface, an actual HTML5 canvas based Chessboard with all the pieces moving. All he needs to do now is connect his server side chess rule checking to the front end, and implement web sockets for multiplayer matches.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.reasonwell.com/">ReasonWell</a> - Ben Williamson talked about his startup and web/mobile app called ReasonWell, a service to facilitate structured online debate.</li>\n<li>SwapSpot - Phuong Lan Trinh talked about her experience at Polycademy, and her plans for building SwapSpot, a service to help car owners swap time limited parking spots. It still needs more work, but she''s planning to finish it in a few months.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.unboxyourgift.com/">Unbox Your Gift</a> - Rita Joyan talked about her business Unbox Your Gift, a step by step system designed to get you to identify your Gift/purpose and to use it to exit the rat race.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.coseats.com/">Coseats.com</a> - Torsten Herbst showcased the largest ridesharing service in Australia.</li>\n<li>Buhloon - Matt Maher showcased his web application Buhloon that he built through Polycademy. It is a service to help manage rewards and chores for parents and children. In the long term this will teach the children delayed gratification.</li>\n<li>ManageOut - Ross Mullen one of Polycademy''s mentors talked about his a startup he was working called ManageOut in order to help event organisers handle their audience members.</li>\n<li>TripleThink - Joshua Young talked about his latest human machine interaction solution.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/2wCptbkwRuiDZJRUxpBB" alt="Matt Maher Pitching" />\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/srAHKhNTEybEZuo3WevY" alt="Ben Williamson Pitching" />\n\n<img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5zTCzClmRGO5OT9JZGTI" alt="Tim Wee Pitching" />\n\n<p>The students are still free to come and hangout at the office to finish off their apps and we''ll be having regular meetups to go over their progress and discuss opportunities at the meetup group <a href="http://www.meetup.com/polyhack/">ACT Web Application Development & Entrepreneurship Group</a>. We welcome you to join if you''re interested in discussing the latest web technology and enjoy hackathons. </p>\n\n<p>The next cohort is scheduled in 1 week from now, however I''ll be spending some time consolidating our goals and progress. The wiki (online textbook) will need some cleaning up due to changes we made in the 11 weeks. Some of our technology stack changed halfway due to the nature of our goals. I''ll also be redesigning the Polycademy website and bringing in an alumni page with links to the hosted demos and some video interviews! Stay tuned to check out their web application demos, and for up coming events!</p>', '2013-04-27 20:38:29', 1, 'teaching,events,coding', 'final_pitches_and_canberra_tech_startup_demo_day');

(145, 'Bootcamps also teach you how to learn', '<p>Recently ComputerWorld in NZ published 2 articles ("<a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/bootcamp-approach-wont-create-it-professionals-iitp#3E36F5087F590FACCC257B670079CA80">Bootcamp approach won''t create IT professionals</a>" & "<a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/developer-bootcamps-good-or-bad">http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/developer-bootcamps-good-or-bad</a>") comparing a 3 year university degree versus a 3 month bootcamp. They asked the question would a bootcamp work in New Zealand?</p>\n\n<p>One of the commentator''s opinions is that in university you learn how to learn, but in bootcamps you simply get technical training and that''s it. I beg to differ.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to explain in the comment section just how bootcamps teach you how to learn as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The best developers I find are the ones that are self-taught. It doesn''t matter whether they are university trained or bootcamp trained or both. In the end everybody has to commit to life long learning, especially in the development world when technology changes so fast and your current skills become outdated in 5 years or so.</p>\n<p>Therefore my bootcamp endeavours to teach how to learn. The students of Polycademy "learn how to learn" as well. While we may focus on a particular technology stack, that stack is simply used in order to illustrate or demonstrate a concept. Yes the students of a bootcamp hit the ground running. But they hit the ground with the understanding that there is so much more to learn, we don''t teach them everything in 3 months. It''s impossible. I doubt a university teaches them everything in 3 years either. However the 3 months gives them confidence, an overview, and skills to take themselves forward in their career, startup or whatever life goals they want to pursue.</p>\n<p>I think the comparison between a 3 month bootcamp and a 3 year uni degree is somewhat unfair and apples vs oranges. In a 3 year uni degree, you do not spend 24/7 studying. A lot of that time is spent partying, working, procrastinating, daily life stuff and finally a bit of studying. In our 3 months, there''s a reason why it''s called a bootcamp. It''s intensive. In that 3 months time, I''ve calculated myself that it was worth (in terms of just contact hours) more than 4 uni 6unit courses (Australian terminology). We don''t have the advantages of time that university has. We have barely the kind of funding a university has. We only have 3 months, so we focus on what we do best. Teaching and learning and collaborating. I''m sure if our students spent 3 years with us, they would learn more if not comparably with a university. Think about in this way. After those 3 months, they can pursue other paths, perhaps more learning, perhaps on the job learning. But we have definitely condensed their learning time and made them a lot more productive and confident versus spending 3 months at university.</p>\n</blockquote>', '2013-05-11 08:22:29', 1, 'teaching,coding,business', 'bootcamps_also_teach_you_how_to_learn');
