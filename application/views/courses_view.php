									<h4>What is it?</h4>
									<p>The 6 months standard involves 7 hours per week instruction time plus 3 hours per week free time. The class size is limited to 15 students and we recommend you to get into a team of 2 or 3. During after hours, the classroom will be open for you to chill out and meet the other students.</p>
									<p>Our three philosophies at Polycademy is <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong>, <strong>Agile Development</strong> and <strong>Flipped Classroom</strong>.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>MVP</strong> means designing your product so it is minimum enough to launch quickly to get market testing, and viable enough to make your product distinct from competitors.</li>
										<li><strong>Agile Development</strong> is about rapid and flexible incremental iteration to code. Rather than memorising the whole corpus of programming in 6 months, each week is a milestone in which parts of your product will be deployed.</li>
										<li><strong>Flipped Classroom</strong> means that before class an online ecosystem of materials will be provided to you. During class we'll keep it practical by spending time discussing models, cutting code, and deploying applications to the cloud.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>We'll be arranging your team with a mentor who will volunteer their time to coach your team on the entrepenurial or development process.</p>
									<p>At the end of 24 weeks, a careers/pitching fair will be opened. Tech employers and investors will be invited to check out your work.</p>
