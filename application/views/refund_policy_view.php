					<h4>The Courses</h4>
					<p>Training will be a combination of lectures, curated content, competitions and practical exercises.There is no requirement for after-hours work, but it is expected that because of the intense nature of the training STUDENT might need to work evenings and weekends. STUDENT assumes full responsibility for their physical and emotional wellbeing.</p>
					<h4>Tuition</h4>
					<p>STUDENT understands that deposit ($500) is due within 7 days of signing this agreement. This is effective for both upfront and weekly payments.</p>
					<p>If STUDENT elects to pay upfront, the remainder of the upfront payment is due within 21 days of signing this agreement.</p>
					<p>If STUDENT elects to pay weekly, the first week's payment is due within 21 days of signing this agreement. If STUDENT is paying weekly, then the deposit will be refunded at the course's completion.</p>
					<p>The deposit is non-refundable if the STUDENT elects to cancel the agreement.</p>
					<h4>Investment & Employment</h4>
					<p>POLYCADEMY will make earnest efforts to connect STUDENT with tech investors and recruiters. However POLYCADEMY does not offer any formal qualifications. It does not guarantee you investment in your project or employability afterwards.</p>
					<h4>Termination of Agreement</h4>
